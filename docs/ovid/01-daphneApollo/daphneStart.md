# Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ Book 1: Daphne & Apollo
# 1.438 - 1.473 (Beginning)

## Apollo & the Python

Illa[^1] quidem nollet[^2], sed te quoque, maxime Python[^3],

tum genuit, populisque novis, incognita serpens,

terror eras: tantum[^4] spatii de monte tenebas.               **440**

hunc deus[^5] arcitenens, numquam[^6] letalibus armis

ante nisi in dammis[^7] capreisque[^7] fugacibus usus,

mille gravem telis exhausta paene pharetra

perdidit effuso per vulnera nigra veneno.

neve[^8] operis famam posset delere vetustas[^9],               **445**

instituit sacros celebri[^10] certamine ludos,

Pythia[^11] de domitae serpentis nomine dictos.

hic[^12] iuvenum quicumque[^13] manu pedibusve[^14] rotave[^14]

vicerat, aesculeae[^15] capiebat frondis honorem.

nondum[^16] laurus erat, longoque decentia crine               **450**

tempora[^17] cingebat de qualibet[^18] arbore Phoebus[^19].

## Cupid & Apollo

Primus amor Phoebi Daphne[^20] Peneia[^21], quem non

fors ignara dedit, sed saeva[^22] Cupidinis ira,

Delius[^23] hunc[^24] nuper, victa serpente superbus,

viderat adducto flectentem cornua[^25] nervo[^26]               **455**

'quid[^27]' que[^28] 'tibi, lascive puer, cum fortibus armis?'

dixerat: 'ista decent umeros gestamina[^29] nostros[^30],

qui[^31] dare certa ferae, dare vulnera possumus hosti,

qui modo[^32] pestifero tot iugera[^33] ventre prementem

stravimus innumeris tumidum Pythona[^34] sagittis.               **460**

tu face[^35] nescio[^36] quos esto[^37] contentus amores

inritare tua, nec laudes adsere nostras!'

filius huic Veneris 'figat[^38] tuus omnia, Phoebe,

te meus arcus' ait; 'quantoque[^39] animalia cedunt

cuncta deo, tanto[^39] minor[^40] est tua gloria nostra.'               **465**

dixit et eliso[^41] percussis aere pennis

inpiger umbrosa Parnasi[^42] constitit arce

eque sagittifera prompsit duo tela pharetra

diversorum[^43] operum: fugat[^44] hoc, facit illud amorem;

quod[^45] facit, auratum est et cuspide fulget acuta,               **470**

quod[^46] fugat, obtusum est et habet sub harundine plumbum.

hoc[^47] deus in nympha Peneide fixit, at illo[^47]

laesit Apollineas[^48] traiecta per ossa medullas;

## Commentary


[^1]: _Illa_ : this refers to [Tellus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(mythology)), the Roman mother earth goddess. Gaia is her Greek counterpart. In the section before, Tellus brings forth the creatures of the land after the world has been destroyed in a suspiciously biblical flood. 

[^2]: _nollet_ : **potential subjunctive**, *she would not have wanted....*

[^3]: _Python_ : the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)) is a huge snake that plagued the area around Delphi. In some versions of this myth, it was also the monster sent to terrorize [Latona (Leto)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leto), the mother of Diana and Apollo, sent by Juno to chase her all over the earth to prevent her from giving birth to the sacred twins from Latona's affair with Jupiter. 

[^4]: _tantum spatii_ : literally "so much of space," but *so much space* sounds a lot better

[^5]: _deus arcitenens_ : this lofty epithet establishes Apollo as the main character here, and also gives this passage some epic flair

[^6]: _numquam ...ante..._ : because the world and its creatures are so new (newly created by Tellus), Apollo hasn't needed to use his weapons much before

[^7]: _dammis capreisque_ : red deer and roe deer. This emphasizes the fact that Apollo has only hunted ease prey up to this point

[^8]: _neve_ : *and so that .....not*, *ne-* + *-ve*

[^9]: _vetustas_ : remember that there are a class of **3rd declension nouns** in the *-tas, -tatis* pattern, making this your nominative subject

[^10]: _celebri certamine_ : **ablative of description**, *with a celebrated contest*

[^11]: _Pythia_ : the [Pythian Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythian_Games) take their name from Apollo conquering the Python (in some versions of the myth). These games are held every four years at Delphi to honor Apollo, and the winners recieve a laurel crown (important to remember!) for their victory

[^12]: _hic_ : remember that *hic* can either from *hic, haec, hoc* or *hic* the adverb meaning *here*. If you don't need *hic* as a singular, masculine, subject, and there's nothing singular, masculine, and nominative for it to describe, then it's likely *hic* as in *here*

[^13]: _quicumque_ : *whoever*

[^14]: _-ve.....-ve_ : *either...or*

[^15]: _aesculeae...frondis_ : *aesculeus, -a, -um* refers to any of a variety of oak trees

[^16]: _nondum laurus erat_ : As often in Ovid, he's teasing the ending of the story he's about to tell, giving us the origin story of the laurel tree

[^17]: _tempora_ : *tempus, -oris* (n) can also mean *temple* as in the part of your forehead

[^18]: _de qualibet arbore_ : *from whatever tree you please*, the *qualibet* refers to any unspecified tree, doesn't matter which one. 

[^19]: _Phoebus_ : Phoebus is another name for or sometimes an epithet of Apollo

[^20]: _Daphne_ : Daphne is a nymph, or sometimes a mortal woman. Her name is in the Greek Declension, so this is her nominative. She would decline as such : **Nom.** *Daphn**e***, **Gen.** *Daphn**es***, **Dat.** *Daphn**ae***, **Acc.** *Daphn**en***, **Abl.** *Daphn**e***

[^21]: _Peneia_ : Daphne is the daughter of [Peneus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peneus), a river god. *Peneia* is a [patroynmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic) adjective, describing Daphne. Translate as *daughter of Peneus* or as *Peneian*, continuing the epic tone of this passage

[^22]: _saeva Cupidinis ira_ : hopefully this phrase makes you think of another [epic moment echoed in this line](https://brclar15.github.io/cmAPLatin/docs/vergil/01-vergil1/vergil1_proem.html), including the **transferred epithet**

[^23]: _Delius_ : *Delian (Apollo)*, an epithet tying him to the island of [Delos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delos), where he was born. Another moment of epic flair

[^24]: _hunc_ : this refers to Cupid

[^25]: _cornua_ : *conru, -us* (n) is 4th declension neuter, so this is your direct object here

[^26]: _nervo_ : *nervus, -i* (m) here is a *bowstring*, which were originally made out of the sinew of animal muscle

[^27]: _quid tibi .....cum fortibus armis?_ : you want something like "*what are strong arms to you?* or "*what are you doing with strong arms?*", a bit of a conversational expression

[^28]: _que_ : this -*que* is OUTSIDE of the quotes, but connects the *viderat* and the *dixerat*

[^29]: _gestamina_ : a *gestamen, -minis* (n) is an "implement or tool," a lofty, warlike war

[^30]: _nostros_ : Apollo is using the "royal we," referring to himself in the plural in an arrogant way

[^31]: _qui dare....hosti_ : take it like this : *qui dare certa [vulnera] ferae [possumus], dare [certa] vulnera possumus hosti*

[^32]: _modo_ : *just now*, emphasizing the coninuity in the story. Apollo has just killed the Python right before this conversation

[^33]: _tot iugera_ : take this as your direct object of *prementem*. A *iuger, -eris* (n) is a measure of land, let's just call it an *acre*

[^34]: _Pythona_ : Python is in a Greek declension, take this as accusative, masculine, singular

[^35]: _face_ : *fax, facis* (f) is a *torch*, which are commonly associated with the Roman marriage rite. Take this as ablative of means with *inritare*

[^36]: _nescio quos_ : "*I know not which*," meaning *"I don't care which, whichever ones"*

[^37]: _esto_ : this is an **imperative** of *sum*. Translate it as "*be....*"

[^38]: _figat_ : notice this as **potential subjunctive**, since your principal parts are *figo, fig**ere***. "*you might/may pierce*"

[^39]: _quanto....tanto_ : these are **correlatives**, "*as much as....*". To the degree that *cuncta animalia deo cedunt*, to that same degree is *minorest tua gloria nostra*

[^40]: _minor est tua gloria nostra_ : Use context (or scansion!) to see which one which adjective is your subject, and which is your **ablative of comparison**

[^41]: _eliso percussis aere pennis_ : a truly beautiful **ablative absolute** with an **ablative of means** embedded with breathtaking **synchisis**. What a delight. Take a moment to stand in awe of this line

[^42]: _Parnasi_ : [Mt. Parnasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Parnassus) is a major mountain in Greece on which Delphi sits. It is also the home of the muses, famed for inspiring poets

[^43]: _diversorum operum_: : **genitive of description**

[^44]: _fugat_ : remember that while *fugio, fug**ere*** means "to flee," *fugo, fug**are*** means "to MAKE someone else flee"

[^45]: _quod facit_ : "*the one that makes [love]*"

[^46]: _quod fugat_ : "*the one that repels [love]*"

[^47]: _hoc, illo_ : often when you get forms of _hic, haec, hoc_ and _ille, illa, illud_ together in one sentence, they mean "this one....and that one...." _Hoc_ is the arrow that repels love, and _illo_ is the arrow that causes love

[^48]: _Apollineas_ : translate as *Apollonian*, another epic sound adjective
