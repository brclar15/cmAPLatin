## Speech of Marius

---------------

[85] **"I know, fellow citizens, that it is by very different methods that most men ask for power at your hands and exercise it after it has been secured; that at first they are industrious, humble and modest, but afterwards they lead lives of indolence and arrogance. But the right course, in my opinion, is just the opposite; for by as much as the whole commonwealth is of more value than a consulate or a praetorship, so much greater ought to be the care with which it is governed than that which is shown in seeking those offices. Nor am I unaware how great a task I am taking upon myself in accepting this signal favor of yours. To prepare for war and at the same time to spare the treasury; to force into military service those whom one would not wish to offend; to have a care for everything at home and abroad — to do all this amid envy, enmity and intrigue, is a ruder task, fellow citizens, than you might suppose. Furthermore, if others make mistakes, their ancient nobility, the brave deeds of their ancestors, the power of their kindred and relatives, their throng of clients, are all a very present help. My hopes are all vested in myself and must be maintained by my own worth and integrity; for all other supports are weak.**

**"This too I understand, fellow citizens, that the eyes of all are turned towards me, that the just and upright favor me because my services are a benefit to our country, while the nobles are looking for a chance to attack me. Wherefore I must strive the more earnestly that you may not be deceived and that they may be disappointed. From childhood to my present time of life I have so lived that I am familiar with every kind of hardship and danger. As to the efforts, fellow citizens, which before your favors were conferred upon me I made without recompense, it is not my intention to relax them now that they have brought me their reward. To make a moderate use of power is difficult for those who from interested motives have pretended to be virtuous; for me, who have spent my entire life in exemplary conduct, habit has made right living a second nature.**

"Bellum me gerere cum Iugurtha iussistis[^1], quam rem nobilitas aegerrime tulit. Quaeso, reputate cum animis vestris, num[^2] id mutare melius sit, si quem[^3] ex illo globo nobilitatis ad hoc aut aliud tale negotium mittatis, hominem veteris prosapiae ac multarum imaginum[^4] et nullius stipendi[^5]: scilicet ut in tanta re ignarus omnium trepidet, festinet, sumat aliquem ex populo monitorem offici sui. Ita plerumque evenit, ut, quem vos imperare iussistis, is sibi imperatorem alium quaerat. Atque ego scio, Quirites[^6], qui, postquam consules facti sunt, et acta maiorum et Graecorum militaria praecepta[^7] legere coeperint: praeposteri homines....! 

"Comparate nunc, Quirites, cum illorum[^8] superbia me hominem novum. Quae illi audire aut legere solent, eorum partem vidi, alia egomet[^9] gessi; quae illi litteris, ea ego militando didici. Nunc vos existimate, facta an[^10] dicta pluris[^11] sint. Contemnunt novitatem meam, ego illorum ignaviam; mihi fortuna, illis probra obiectantur. Quamquam ego naturam unam et communem omnium existimo, sed fortissimum quemque generosissimum. Ac si iam ex patribus Albini[^12] aut Bestiae[^12] quaeri posset, mene an[^10] illos ex se gigni maluerint, quid responsuros creditis nisi sese liberos quam optimos voluisse? 

**"But if they rightly look down on me, let them also look down on their own forefathers, whose nobility began, as did my own, in manly deeds. They begrudge me my office; then let them begrudge my toil, my honesty, even my dangers, since it was through those that I won the office. In fact, these men, spoiled by pride, live as if they scorned your honors, but seek them as if their own lives were honorable. Surely they are deceived when they look forward with equal confidence to things which are worlds apart, the joys of idleness and the rewards of merit. Even when they speak to you or address the senate, their theme is commonly a eulogy of their ancestors; by recounting the exploits of their forefathers they imagine themselves more glory. The very reverse is true. The more glorious was the life of their ancestors, the more shameful is their own baseness. Assuredly the matter stands thus: the glory of ancestors is, as it were, a light shining upon their posterity, suffering neither their virtues nor their faults to be hidden.** 

Huiusce[^13] rei[^14] ego inopiam fateor, Quirites, verum[^15], id[^16] quod multo praeclarius est, meamet[^9] facta mihi dicere licet. Nunc videte, quam[^17] iniqui sint. Quod[^18] ex aliena virtute sibi arrogant, id mihi ex mea non concedunt, scilicet quia imagines non habeo et quia mihi nova nobilitas est, quam[^19] certe peperisse melius est quam acceptam corrupisse.

"Equidem ego non ignoro, si iam mihi respondere velint, abunde illis facundam et compositam[^20] orationem fore. Sed in maximo vestro beneficio cum omnibus locis meque vosque maledictis lacerent, non placuit reticere, ne quis[^21] modestiam in conscientiam duceret[^22]. Nam me quidem ex animi mei sententia nulla oratio[^23] laedere potest: quippe[^24] vera necesse est bene praedicent, falsa[^25] vita moresque mei superant. Sed quoniam vestra consilia accusantur, qui mihi summum honorem et maximum negotium imposuistis, etiam atque etiam reputate, num[^26] eorum paenitendum sit. Non possum fidei causa[^27] imagines neque triumphos aut consulatus maiorum meorum ostentare, at, si res postulet, hastas, vexillum, phaleras, alia militaria dona, praeterea cicatrices adverso corpore. Hae sunt meae imagines, haec nobilitas, non hereditate relicta, ut illa[^28] illis, sed quae ego meis plurimis laboribus et periculis quaesivi. 

"Non sunt composita[^20] verba mea: parvi[^29] id facio. Ipsa se virtus satis ostendit; illis artificio opus[^30] est, ut turpia facta oratione tegant. Neque litteras Graecas didici: parum[^31] placebat eas discere, quippe quae ad virtutem doctoribus nihil profuerant. At illa multo[^32] optima rei publicae doctus sum: hostem ferire, praesidia agitare, nihil metuere nisi turpem famam, hiemem et aestatem iuxta[^33] pati, humi requiescere, eodem tempore inopiam et laborem tolerare. His ego praeceptis milites hortabor, neque illos arte colam, me opulenter, neque gloriam meam, laborem illorum faciam. Hoc est utile, hoc civile imperium. Namque cum tute[^34] per mollitiem agas, exercitum supplicio cogere, id est dominum, non imperatorem esse. Haec atque alia talia maiores vestri faciendo seque remque publicam celebravere. Quis[^35] nobilitas freta, ipsa dissimilis moribus, nos illorum aemulos[^36] contemnit et omnes honores non ex merito, sed quasi debitos a vobis repetit. Ceterum[^37] homines superbissimi procul errant. Maiores eorum omnia quae licebat illis reliquere: divitias, imagines, memoriam sui praeclaram; virtutem non reliquere, neque poterant: ea sola neque datur dono neque accipitur. Sordidum me et incultis[^38] moribus aiunt, quia parum[^31] scite[^39] convivium exorno neque histrionem ullum neque pluris[^40] preti coquum quam vilicum habeo. Quae mihi libet confiteri, Quirites. Nam ex parente meo et ex aliis sanctis viris ita accepi[^41], munditias mulieribus, viris laborem convenire, omnibusque bonis oportere plus gloriae quam divitiarum esse; arma, non supellectilem decori[^42] esse. 

"Quin ergo, quod[^43] iuvat, quod[^43] carum aestimant, id semper faciant: ament[^44], potent[^44]; ubi adulescentiam habuere, ibi senectutem agant[^44], in conviviis, dediti ventri et turpissimae parti corporis; sudorem, pulverem et alia talia relinquant[^44] nobis, quibus illa epulis iucundiora[^45] sunt. Verum non ita est. Nam ubi se flagitiis dedecoravere turpissimi viri, bonorum praemia ereptum[^46] eunt. Ita iniustissime luxuria et ignavia, pessimae artes, illis, qui coluere eas, nihil officiunt, rei[^47] publicae innoxiae cladi sunt. 

**"Now that I have replied to them to the extent that my character — but not their crimes — demanded I shall say a few words about our country. First of all, be of good cheer as to Numidia, citizens; for you have put away everything which up to this time has protected Jugurtha — avarice, incompetence, and arrogance. Furthermore, there is an army in Africa familiar with the country, but by heaven! more valiant than fortunate; for a great part of it has perished through the greed or rashness of its leaders. Therefore do you, who are of military age, join your efforts with mine and serve your country, and let no one feel fear because of disasters to others or the arrogance of generals. I, Marius, shall be with you on the march and in battle, at once your counsellor and the companion of your dangers, and I shall treat myself and you alike in all respects. And surely with the help of the gods everything is ripe for us — victory, spoils, glory; but even though these were uncertain or remote, yet all good men ought to fly to the aid of their fatherland. Truly, no one ever became immortal through cowardice, and no parent would wish for his children that they might live forever, but rather that their lives might be noble and honored. I would say more, citizens, if words could make cowards brave. For the resolute I think I have spoken abundantly."**
