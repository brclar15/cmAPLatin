# *Laudatio Turiae* 2a–9a

## Introduction

The Laudatio Turiae is an inscription that records the life events of an outstanding Roman woman, Turia, whose full identity is lost to us. Her husband set up this remarkable funerary inscription to record his love for
his wife and her daring acts to hide and protect him during the civil wars of the first century BCE. Traditionally, scholars have identified the husband as Quintus Lucretius Vespillo, who was consul in 19 BCE. However, the portion of the inscription that records their names is missing, and scholars generally are uncertain of the pair’s actual identities. While the full inscription is 180 lines long, this portion recounts Turia’s efforts to help her husband hide from political persecution in 49 BCE, during the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.

## Text

Amplissima subsidia fugae meae praestitisti. Ornamentis

vitam meam instruxisti, cum omne aurum margaritaque

corpori tuo detracta tradidisti mihi—et subinde familia,

nummis, fructibus, callide deceptis adversariorum

custodibus, absentiam meam locupletasti. Pro vita rogabas	**5**

absentis—quod ut conarere virtus tua te hortabatur. Verbis

tuis victa me munibat clementia eorum, contra quos ea

parabas. Semper tamen vox tua est firmitate animi emissa.

Interea agmen ex repertis hominibus a Milone, cuius domus

emptione potitus eram cum esset exsul, belli civilis			**10**

occasionibus irrupturum et direpturum prospere reiecisti et

defendisti domum nostram.

---------


line 1 	fugae meae: Turia’s husband, an ally of Pompey, was forced to flee after Julius Caesar defeated Pompey’s forces at the Battle of Pharsalus in 49 BCE.
        3 	corpori = corpore
 	detracta: refers to omne aurum margaritaque
 	familia = servis. The term here refers not to the father, mother, child, etc., but to those that make up the extended Roman family (i.e., those who are enslaved).
        5 	locupletasti = locupletavisti
 	Pro vita rogabas absentis = “you begged for my life while (I was) absent.”  To whom she pleaded is not clear, but absentis probably indicates that her husband was abroad.
        6 	ut conarere: a command indirectly stated after hortabatur
 	conarere = conareris
        7 	victa = victorum. Despite its neuter plural form, this participle describes the same men to whom eorum and quos refer (i.e., those who had the means to intercede on Vespillo’s behalf). The feminine singular form is due possibly to the author’s artful intent that the word agree with clementia.
 	munibat = muniebat
 	ea: refers to verbis tuis
        9 	agmen: “posse (of armed men)” is perhaps the best translation, as it refers to the men Milo commonly used to intimidate and harass political opponents.
      10 	exsul: Milo was exiled from Rome in 52 BC, after being convicted of election bribery and violence in the murder of one of his political opponents, Publius Clodius Pulcher.
 	belli civilis: The civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great, which lasted from 49 BCE to 45 BCE.
