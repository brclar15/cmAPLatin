# *Laudatio Turiae* 2a–9a

## Introduction

The _Laudatio Turiae_ is an inscription that records the life events of an outstanding Roman woman, **Turia**, whose full identity is lost to us. Her husband set up this remarkable funerary inscription to record his love for his wife and her daring acts to hide and protect him during the civil wars of the first century BCE. Traditionally, scholars have identified the husband as Quintus Lucretius Vespillo, who was consul in 19 BCE. However, the portion of the inscription that records their names is missing, and scholars generally are uncertain of the pair’s actual identities. While the full inscription is 180 lines long, this portion recounts Turia’s efforts to help her husband hide from political persecution in 49 BCE, during the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.

_Amplissima_ _subsidia_ fugae[^1] meae praestitisti. _Ornamentis_[^2]

vitam meam _instruxisti_, cum omne aurum _margaritaque_

corpori[^3] tuo _detracta_[^4] tradidisti mihi — et _subinde_ familia[^5],

_nummis, fructibus, callide deceptis adversariorum_

custodibus, _absentiam_ meam _locupletasti_[^6]. Pro[^7] vita rogabas	**5**

_absentis_ — quod ut[^8] _conarere_[^9] virtus tua te _hortabatur_. Verbis

tuis victa[^10] me _munibat[^11] clementia_ eorum, contra quos ea[^12]

parabas. Semper tamen vox tua est _firmitate_ animi _emissa_.

Interea agmen[^13] ex _repertis_ hominibus a _Milone_, cuius domus

_emptione_ _potitus_ eram cum esset _exsul_[^14], belli[^15] _civilis_			**10**

_occasionibus irrupturum_ et _direpturum prospere reiecisti_ et

defendisti domum nostram.

## Commentary

[^1]: _fugae meae_: Turia’s husband, an ally of Pompey, was forced to flee after Julius Caesar defeated Pompey’s forces at the Battle of Pharsalus in 49 BCE.
[^2]: _ornamentis_ = “_with the things I needed_”
[^3]: _corpori_ = _corpore_
[^4]: _detracta_: refers to _omne aurum margaritaque_
[^5]: _familia_ = _servis_. The term here refers not to the father, mother, child, etc., but to those that make up the extended Roman family (i.e., those who are enslaved).
[^6]: _locupletasti_ = _locupletavisti_
[^7]: _Pro vita rogabas absentis_ = “_you begged for my life while (I was) absent_.”  To whom she pleaded is not clear, but _absentis_ probably indicates that her husband was abroad.
[^8]: _ut conarere_: a command indirectly stated after _hortabatur_
[^9]: _conarere_ = _conareris_
[^10]: _victa_ = _victorum_. Despite its neuter plural form, this participle describes the same men to whom _eorum_ and _quos_ refer (i.e., those who had the means to intercede on Vespillo’s behalf). The feminine singular form is due possibly to the author’s artful intent that the word agree with _clementia_.
[^11]: _munibat_ = _muniebat_
[^12]: _ea_: refers to _verbis tuis_
[^13]: _agmen_: “_posse (of armed men)_” is perhaps the best translation, as it refers to the men Milo commonly used to intimidate and harass political opponents.
[^14]: _exsul_: Milo was exiled from Rome in 52 BC, after being convicted of election bribery and violence in the murder of one of his political opponents, Publius Clodius Pulcher.
[^15]: _belli civilis_: The civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great, which lasted from 49 BCE to 45 BCE.
