# Augustine's *Confessions* 1.14.23

## Introduction

Aurelius Augustinus Hipponensis, better known as Augustine of Hippo, was a highly influential north African Christian theologian who lived and wrote in late Roman antiquity. His family were Berbers (an ethnic group indigenous to north Africa), highly Romanized, and members of the Roman aristocracy.  The Confessions, from which the following passage is drawn, is among his most famous works and is widely considered to be the first Western autobiography. The work focuses heavily on Augustine’s inner experiences, primarily through his reflections on his education and other life events and, at the same time, his gradual conversion from paganism to Christianity.  Through these personal anecdotes, Augustine frequently proposes broad philosophical and religious insights.

## Text

Cur ergo Graecam etiam grammaticam oderam talia

cantantem? Nam et Homerus peritus texere tales fabellas

et dulcissime vanus est, mihi tamen amarus erat puero.

Credo etiam Graecis pueris Vergilius ita sit, cum eum sic

discere coguntur ut ego illum. Videlicet difficultas, difficultas		**5**

omnino ediscendae linguae peregrinae, quasi felle

aspergebat omnes suavitates Graecas fabulosarum

narrationum. Nulla enim verba illa noveram, et saevis

terroribus ac poenis ut nossem instabatur mihi vehementer.

Nam et Latina aliquando infans utique nulla noveram, et			**10**

tamen advertendo didici sine ullo metu atque cruciatu, inter

etiam blandimenta nutricum et ioca adridentium et laetitias

adludentium. Didici vero illa sine poenali onere urgentium.

Hinc satis elucet maiorem habere vim ad discenda ista

liberam curiositatem quam meticulosam necessitatem.			**15**

## Commentary


line 1 	grammaticam: literally “(a system of) grammar,” but here it means the “(Greek) language and literature” or, specifically, “(Greek) poetry”
 	talia: supply carmina; etiam...talia (“also...such...”) establishes a contrast between the Greek epic poetry of Homer and the Latin epic poetry of the Aeneid. Just before this passage, Augustine had been discussing his love of the Aeneid.
        2 	cantantem: modifies a personified Graecam grammaticam, “the Greek language, that sings...” 
 	texere: the infinitive completes the idea of peritus, “skillful at...”
        3 	vanus: This description of Homer here alludes back to the larger context of Augustine’s discussion in sections 12 and 13 of the Confessions, in which he contrasts his own misguided, youthful love of epic poetry (in particular, the Aeneid) to, in his opinion, the upright love for Christian scripture. According to his account, epic poetry is empty, deceptive, and a distraction from becoming a better Christian.
 	puero: taken together with mihi, “as a boy”
        4 	sit: Classical Latin would use an infinitive as the main verb of the indirect statement introduced by credo, but Latin after the second century CE began to substitute this with the subjunctive (usually introduced with quod).
        5 	illum: refers to Homer
        6 	ediscendae: gerundive with linguae
        7 	aspergebat: the subject is difficultas
        9 	nossem = novissem; perfect forms of nosco, noscere have a present meaning, pluperfect forms have a perfect meaning instabatur: used impersonally, “it was demanded”
      10 	et =“even”
 	Latina nulla: supply verba
 	infans: taken together with the subject of noveram, “as an infant”
  12–13 	adridentium...adludentium...urgentium: adjectives being used substantively
      13 	illa: refers to Latina (verba)
      14 	elucet: used impersonally, “it is clear”
 	ista: refers to Latina (verba)
      15 	liberam curiositatem: accusative subjective of habere
