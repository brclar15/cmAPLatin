# Ovid's *Fasti* 2.83 – 2.86, 2.95 – 2.100, 2.103 – 2.116

## Introduction

Arion was a famous Greek musician about whom we know little for certain. According to the mythology that developed around him, he was the son of Poseidon and a nymph named Oncaea. Historically speaking, he was known as a friend of Periander, a tyrant of the Greek city of Corinth. As such, Arion spent a long time at Periander’s court. Arion is also credited with inventing a kind of poetry called the dithyramb, which was a type of hymn that was sung and danced in honor of Dionysus. According to the Greek writer Herodotus, Arion attended and won a musical competition in Sicily. On his way back home, Arion was kidnapped by pirates, who intended to steal the prize that he had just won. Ovid recounts this story in his Fasti, a poem of six books 
comprised of mythological stories that explain the origin of all the holidays on the Roman calendar. The story of Arion and the dolphin he summoned to escape is recorded in the entry for February 3.

## Text


Quod mare non novit, quae nescit _Ariona_ tellus?

Carmine currentes ille tenebat aquas.

Saepe sequens _agnam_ lupus est a voce _retentus_,

saepe _avidum_ fugiens _restitit_ agna lupum.

Inde domum _repetens_ _puppem_ conscendit Arion,			**5**

atque ita quaesitas arte ferebat opes.

_Forsitan_, infelix, ventos undasque timebas:

at tibi nave tua tutius aequor erat.

Namque _gubernator_ _destricto_ _constitit_ _ense_

ceteraque _armata_ _conscia_ turba manu.				**10**

Ille, metu _pavidus_, “Mortem non _deprecor_” inquit,

“sed liceat sumpta pauca referre lyra.”

Dant _veniam_ ridentque moram: capit ille _coronam_,

quae possit _crines_, _Phoebe_, _decere_ tuos;

induerat _Tyrio_ _bis_ _tinctam_ _murice_ _pallam_:				**15**

reddidit _icta_ suos _pollice_ _chorda_ sonos,

_flebilibus_ numeris veluti _canentia_ dura

_traiectus_ _penna_ _tempora_ _cantat_ _olor_.

_Protinus_ in medias _ornatus_ _desilit_ undas;

_spargitur_ impulsa _caerula_ puppis aqua.				**20**

Inde (fide _maius_) tergo _delphina_ _recurvo_

_se memorant oneri subposuisse_ novo.

Ille, sedens _citharamque_ tenens, _pretiumque_ _vehendi_

cantat et _aequoreas_ carmine _mulcet_ aquas.

----------


[^1]: _novit_: perfect forms of _nosco_, _noscere_ have a present meaning 
[^1]: _Ariona_: Greek accusative of _Arion_
[^1]: _tenebat_ = “_could hold back_”; the imperfect tense can denote general capability, as it does here.
[^1]: _infelix_: vocative; here, the poet addresses Arion directly (a stylistic device called “**apostrophe**”).
[^1]: _armata_: ablative to agree with _manu_
[^1]: _ille_: refers to Arion
[^1]: _liceat_ = “_let it be permitted_”; sc. _mihi_
[^1]: _pauca_: neuter plural and the accusative direct object of _referre_
[^1]: _referre_ : “_to play_” here
[^1]: _quae possit_ : “_(the sort) which could_”
[^1]: _Phoebe_: vocative; here, the poet addresses Apollo directly.
[^1]: _Tyrio...murice_: Murex was a species of snail native to Tyre (in present-day Lebanon) that secreted a purple dye used to stain fabric. The process required vast amounts of the dye and was labor-intensive, so the resulting color was highly valued and very expensive. As a result, only the very rich could afford it, so it became a symbol of wealth and royalty.
[^1]: _pollice_ = _digitis_
[^1]: _numeris_ = “_song_”
[^1]: _penna_: ironically, _penna_ in other contexts refers to a “_feather_.”
[^1]: _tempora_: with _canentia_, “_having been pierced on its white brow_.” This use of the accusative shows where he has been pierced (_traiectus_).
[^1]: _ornatus_: Arion jumped into the ocean fully clothed.
[^1]: _fide maius_: an expression of amazement; the neuter singular _maius_ refers to the sentence as a whole
[^1]: _delphina_: Greek accusative singular
