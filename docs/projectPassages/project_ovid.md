# Ovid's *Fasti* 2.83 – 2.86, 2.95 – 2.100, 2.103 – 2.116

## Introduction

Arion was a famous Greek musician about whom we know little for certain. According to the mythology that developed around him, he was the son of Poseidon and a nymph named Oncaea. Historically speaking, he was known as a friend of Periander, a tyrant of the Greek city of Corinth. As such, Arion spent a long time at Periander’s court. Arion is also credited with inventing a kind of poetry called the dithyramb, which was a type of hymn that was sung and danced in honor of Dionysus. According to the Greek writer Herodotus, Arion attended and won a musical competition in Sicily. On his way back home, Arion was kidnapped by pirates, who intended to steal the prize that he had just won. Ovid recounts this story in his Fasti, a poem of six books 
comprised of mythological stories that explain the origin of all the holidays on the Roman calendar. The story of Arion and the dolphin he summoned to escape is recorded in the entry for February 3.

## Text


Quod mare non novit, quae nescit Ariona tellus?

Carmine currentes ille tenebat aquas.

Saepe sequens agnam lupus est a voce retentus,

saepe avidum fugiens restitit agna lupum.

Inde domum repetens puppem conscendit Arion,			**5**

atque ita quaesitas arte ferebat opes.

Forsitan, infelix, ventos undasque timebas:

at tibi nave tua tutius aequor erat.

Namque gubernator destricto constitit ense

ceteraque armata conscia turba manu.				**10**

Ille, metu pavidus, “Mortem non deprecor” inquit,

“sed liceat sumpta pauca referre lyra.”

Dant veniam ridentque moram: capit ille coronam,

quae possit crines, Phoebe, decere tuos;

induerat Tyrio bis tinctam murice pallam:				**15**

reddidit icta suos pollice chorda sonos,

flebilibus numeris veluti canentia dura

traiectus penna tempora cantat olor.

Protinus in medias ornatus desilit undas;

spargitur impulsa caerula puppis aqua.				**20**

Inde (fide maius) tergo delphina recurvo

se memorant oneri subposuisse novo.

Ille, sedens citharamque tenens, pretiumque vehendi

cantat et aequoreas carmine mulcet aquas.

----------


line 1 	novit: perfect forms of nosco, noscere have a present meaning Ariona: Greek accusative of Arion
        2 	tenebat = “could hold back”; the imperfect tense can denote general capability, as it does here.
        7 	infelix: vocative; here, the poet addresses Arion directly (a stylistic device called “apostrophe”).
      10 	armata: ablative to agree with manu
      11 	ille: refers to Arion
      12 	liceat = “let it be permitted”; sc. mihi
 	pauca: neuter plural and the accusative direct object of referre
 	referre = here, “to play”
      14 	quae possit = “(the sort) which could”
 	Phoebe: vocative; here, the poet addresses Apollo directly.
      15 	Tyrio...murice: Murex was a species of snail native to Tyre (in present-day Lebanon) that secreted a purple dye used to stain fabric. The process required vast amounts of the dye and was labor-intensive, so the resulting color was highly valued and very expensive. As a result, only the very rich could afford it, so it became a symbol of wealth and royalty.
      16 	pollice = digitis
      17 	numeris = “song”
      18 	penna: ironically, penna in other contexts refers to a “feather.”
 	tempora: with canentia, “having been pierced on its white brow.” This use of the accusative shows where he has been pierced (traiectus).
      19 	ornatus: Arion jumped into the ocean fully clothed.
      21 	fide maius: an expression of amazement; the neuter singular maius refers to the sentence as a whole
 	delphina: Greek accusative singular
      22 	se: refers to the dolphin and is the object of subposuisse
      23 	pretium vehendi = “as the price for carrying him”
