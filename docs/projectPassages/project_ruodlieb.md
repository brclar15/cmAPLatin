# Anonymous (11th century AD), *Ruodlieb* 4.194–210

## Introduction

The _Ruodlieb_ is a medieval poem likely written by a now-anonymous German monk. It is written in a meter common to the time, Leonine hexameter, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes—sometimes quite loosely—with the last syllable of a word near the middle of the line. The _Ruodlieb_ tells the tale of a noble young man, Ruodlieb, as he travels abroad to seek his fortune. The poem is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a court romance (which tells of the heroic exploits of medieval knights). However, it exhibits a higher degree of realism than standard court romances. In particular, although Ruodlieb is the hero, he is not all-powerful. Rather than focusing solely on his military prowess, the work focuses more on his sense of duty, self-control, humility, and ability to keep the peace in believable situations. In his travels, Ruodlieb interacts frequently with two (unnamed) kings; the event in the following passage occurs during one of these interactions.

## Text

Rex poscens tabulam iubet opponi sibi sellam
et me contra se iubet in fulchro residere,
ut secum ludam, quod ego nimium renuebam,
dicens “Terribile miserum conludere rege”;
et dum me vidit sibi non audere reniti,			**5**
ludere laudavi, cupiens ab eo superari,
“Vinci de rege” dicens “quid obest miserum me?
Sed timeo, domine, quod mox irasceris in me,
si fortuna iuvet, mihi quod Victoria constet.”
Rex subridendo dixit velut atque iocando:			**10**
“Non opus est, care, super hac re quid vereare:
si numquam vincam, commocior haut ego fiam;
sed, quam districte noscas ludas volo cum me,
nam quos ignotos facies volo discere tractus.”
Statim rex et ego studiose traximus ambo,			**15**
et, sibi gratia sit, mihi ter Victoria cessit,
multis principibus nimis id mirantibus eius.

## Commentary


line 1 	tabulam: refers to a chess board. This is one of the earliest references to chess in European literature. The game had recently been introduced via Islamic influence at the time this poem was written. While the rules had not yet been developed and formalized into their current form, the game was already very popular among European nobility.
 	sibi: dative with the compound verb opponi
        3 	secum = cum se
 	quod: refers to ut secum ludam; “(something) which”
        4 	terribile: supply est with the whole phrase miserum conludere rege as the subject
miserum: supply virum; here “wretched” has the sense of “lower-class” (at least relative to the king)
 	rege: ablative direct object of conludere as a result of the con- (i.e., cum-) prefix
        5 	sibi: dative with the compound verb reniti
        6 	ludere = “playing,” take as the object of laudavi
        7 	quid = quomodo
        obest: take vinci as the subject and miserum me as the object. By the medieval period, authors were inconsistent about the use of the dative with compound verbs.
        9 	mihi: dative with compound verb constet
      10	subridendo and iocando = subridens and iocans. By the medieval period, ablative gerunds were equivalent to nominative present participles.
      11  	quid = aliquid
 	vereare = verearis; supply an ut, “that you...”
      12  	commocior = commotior (from commotus, -a, -um); the spelling of the letter t as a c before an i was common in medieval Latin to reflect the pronunciation of /ts/.
      13 	quam...me = noscas quam districte volo (ut) ludas cum me, “know how seriously I want you to play with me;” with noscas as an independent subjunctive indicating a gentle command and ludas as a command/wish indirectly stated with volo. As the verb of an indirect question introduced by noscas and quam districte, one would expect volo to be in the subjunctive, but medieval Latin is less strict about the mood of subordinate verbs.
      14 	ignotos: supply mihi
  	facies: from the verb facio, -ere not the noun facies, -ei
      16 	sibi: refers to a personified Victoria
 	sibi gratia sit = “let thanks be to her”
      17 	principibus: refers to the nobles watching the chess match
 	id: refers to the whole situation
 	eius: refers to the king
