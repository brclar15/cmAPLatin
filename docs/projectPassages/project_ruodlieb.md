# Anonymous (11th century AD), *Ruodlieb* 4.194–210

## Introduction

The _Ruodlieb_ is a medieval poem likely written by a now-anonymous German monk. It is written in a meter common to the time, Leonine hexameter, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes—sometimes quite loosely—with the last syllable of a word near the middle of the line. The _Ruodlieb_ tells the tale of a noble young man, Ruodlieb, as he travels abroad to seek his fortune. The poem is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a court romance (which tells of the heroic exploits of medieval knights). However, it exhibits a higher degree of realism than standard court romances. In particular, although Ruodlieb is the hero, he is not all-powerful. Rather than focusing solely on his military prowess, the work focuses more on his sense of duty, self-control, humility, and ability to keep the peace in believable situations. In his travels, Ruodlieb interacts frequently with two (unnamed) kings; the event in the following passage occurs during one of these interactions.

## Text

Rex poscens _tabulam_[^1] iubet _opponi_ sibi[^2] sellam

et me contra se iubet in _fulchro_ residere,

ut secum[^3] ludam, quod[^4] ego _nimium renuebam_,

dicens “Terribile[^5] miserum[^6] _conludere_ rege[^7]”;

et dum me vidit sibi[^8] non audere _reniti_,			**5**

ludere[^9] laudavi, cupiens ab eo superari,

“Vinci de rege” dicens “quid[^10] _obest_[^11] miserum me?

Sed timeo, domine, quod mox _irasceris_ _in_ me,

si fortuna iuvet, mihi[^12] quod Victoria _constet_.”

Rex _subridendo_[^13] dixit velut atque _iocando_[^13]:			**10**

“Non opus est, care, _super_ hac re quid[^14] _vereare_[^15]:

si numquam vincam, _commocior_[^16] haut ego fiam;

sed, quam[^17] _districte_ noscas ludas volo cum me,

nam quos _ignotos_[^18] facies[^19] volo discere _tractus_.”

Statim rex et ego _studiose traximus ambo_,			**15**

et, sibi[^20] gratia[^21] sit, mihi _ter_ Victoria cessit,

multis principibus[^22] _nimis_ id[^23] _mirantibus_ eius[^24].

## Commentary


[^1]: _tabulam_: refers to a chess board. This is one of the earliest references to chess in European literature. The game had recently been introduced via Islamic influence at the time this poem was written. While the rules had not yet been developed and formalized into their current form, the game was already very popular among European nobility.
[^2]: _sibi_: dative with the compound verb _opponi_
[^3]: _secum_ = _cum se_
[^4]: _quod_: refers to _ut secum ludam_; “(_something_) _which_”
[^5]: _terribile_: supply _est_ with the whole phrase _miserum conludere rege_ as the subject
[^6]: _miserum_: supply _virum_; here “_wretched_” has the sense of “_lower-class_” (at least relative to the king)
[^7]: _rege_: ablative direct object of _conludere_ as a result of the _con_- (i.e., _cum_-) prefix
[^8]: _sibi_: dative with the compound verb _reniti_
[^9]: _ludere_ = “_playing_,” take as the object of _laudavi_
[^10]: _quid_ = _quomodo_
[^11]: _obest_: take _vinci_ as the subject and _miserum_ me as the object. By the medieval period, authors were inconsistent about the use of the dative with compound verbs.
[^12]: _mihi_: dative with compound verb _constet_
[^13]: _subridendo_ and _iocando_ = _subridens_ and _iocans_. By the medieval period, ablative gerunds were equivalent to nominative present participles.
[^14]: _quid_ = _aliquid_
[^15]: _vereare_ = _verearis_; supply an _ut_, “_that you..._”
[^16]: _commocior_ = _commotior_ (from _commotus, -a, -um_); the spelling of the letter _-t_ as a _-c_ before an _-i_ was common in medieval Latin to reflect the pronunciation of /_ts_/.
[^17]: _quam...me_ = _noscas quam districte volo (ut) ludas cum me_, “_know how seriously I want you to play with me_;” with _noscas_ as an independent subjunctive indicating a gentle command and _ludas_ as a command/wish indirectly stated with _volo_. As the verb of an indirect question introduced by _noscas_ and _quam districte_, one would expect _volo_ to be in the subjunctive, but medieval Latin is less strict about the mood of subordinate verbs.
[^18]: _ignotos_: supply _mihi_
[^19]: _facies_: from the verb _facio, -ere_ NOT the noun _facies, -ei_
[^20]: _sibi_: refers to a personified Victoria
[^21]: _sibi gratia sit_ = “_let thanks be to her_”
[^22]: _principibus_: refers to the nobles watching the chess match
[^23]: _id_: refers to the whole situation
[^24]: _eius_: refers to the king
